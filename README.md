Already wrote a task list app for SBA 9, so the challenge was to refactor everything into the Context API. I do remember doing a bit of prop drilling for SBA 9, so having a context to just pick out what I need for use was helpful. Still a challenge to figure out the "shape" of the context and how to use/consume it.
